Something	pn

I	ppss

my	pp$

And	cc
then	rb
I	ppss

too	rb

glanced	vbd

surreptitiously	rb

I	ppss
felt	vbd
that	cs

a	at

I	ppss
dismissed	vbd

I	ppss
could	md
not	*
get	vb
it	ppo
out	in

we	ppss

When	wrb

You	ppss

the	at

Why	wrb
she	pps

him	ppo
I	ppss

I	ppss
myself	ppl

what	wdt
a	at

Perhaps	rb

with	in
my	pp$

she	pps
found	vbd
a	at

For	in

Even	rb

A	at

Matsuo	np

Matsuo	np
repeatedly	rb

the	at

Because	cs

he	pps

A	at

the	at

leaning	vbg

on	in

Humiliation	nn

While	cs

that	dt

Taking	vbg

Matsuo	np
squeezed	vbd
the	at

and	cc
then	rb
he	pps

He	pps
wanted	vbd
the	at

and	cc
so	cs
he	pps
aimed	vbd

The	at

reverberated	vbd
in	in
diminishing	vbg
whiplashes	nns
of	in

Hush	nn

Like	cs

Matsuo	np
awaited	vbd

How	ql

to	to

The	at

The	at

Before	in

the	at

and	cc
insects	nns
hummed	vbd

Matsuo	np
puzzled	vbd

grew	vbd
anxious	jj

concluding	vbg
that	cs
he	pps

the	at

Five	cd

the	at

abruptly	rb

He	pps

a	at

It	pps

but	cc
jumping	vbg

he	pps

He	pps

With	in

crossing	vbg
the	at

When	wrb

Matsuo	np
noted	vbd
the	at

The	at

The	at

The	at

In	in

Gradually	rb

Down	in

Why	wrb

I	ppss

Once	rb

That	dt

I	ppss

I	ppss

All	ql

everything	pn

There	ex

--	--
I	ppss

I	ppss

this	dt

I	ppss

then	rb
went	vbd

to	to

I	ppss
never	rb

I	ppss
met	vbd
Claire	np

which	wdt

She	pps

eating	vbg

just	rb

and	cc
washing	vbg

I	ppss

I	ppss

so	ql
fast	rb
and	cc
still	rb
be	be

She	pps

and	cc
young	jj
,	,
and	cc
nice	jj
and	cc
round	jj
in	in
a	at
tight	jj

Maybe	rb
her	pp$
ravenous	jj
eating	nn
wasn't	bedz
grotesque	jj
because	cs
she	pps
was	bedz
so	ql
positive	jj
about	in

When	wrb
she	pps
had	hvd
drained	vbn

paid	vbd
her	pp$

she	pps
came	vbd
directly	rb

``	``

``	``

--	--
``	``
yeah	rb

And	cc
so	rb
off	rp
we	ppss
went	vbd

She	pps
was	bedz
a	at

of	in

the	at

Toward	in

and	cc
drew	vbd

Now	rb
it	pps

I	ppss

I	ppss
made	vbd
the	at

The	at

but	cc
I	ppss
didn't	dod

I	ppss
sat	vbd
waiting	vbg
for	in
Life	nn
to	to

and	cc

I	ppss
had	hvd

Pils	nn
(	(
so	rb
help	vb
me	ppo

,	,
then	rb
switched	vbd

After	in
a	at

hours	nns
,	,
Life	nn
hadn't	hvd

and	cc
I	ppss
was	bedz

I	ppss
went	vbd

The	at

a	at

but	cc
what	wdt

?	.
?	.

So	cs
I	ppss
drank	vbd

All	ql
that	dt

I	ppss
drank	vbd

I	ppss

Elemental	jj

That's	dt
what	wdt

I	ppss

I	ppss

My	pp$

A	at

Sometime	rb

the	at

I	ppss

I	ppss

There	ex

I	ppss

Pretty	ql

She	pps

Suddenly	rb
I	ppss

It	pps

Without	in

It	pps

It	pps

I	ppss

She	pps

I	ppss

After	in

Hardly	rb

The	at

that	dt

I	ppss

At	in

Johnnie	np
hadn't	hvd

--	--
how	wrb

he	pps

not	*

?	.

But	cc
then	rb
he	pps

``	``
All	ql

But	cc
what	wdt

trying	vbg

I	ppss

I	ppss

So	cs
one	cd

I	ppss

My	pp$

I	ppss
was	bedz

to	to

him	ppo
whatever	wdt

he	pps

and	cc
to	to

him	ppo
from	in

And	cc
,	,
though	cs
at	in
the	at

I	ppss
blushed	vbd
to	to
admit	vb
it	ppo
even	rb
to	in

there	ex

a	at

an	at

I	ppss
wanted	vbd
him	ppo

with	in
a	at
terrifying	vbg

Astonishingly	rb
enough	qlp

it	pps
was	bedz

Outside	rb

And	cc
I	ppss
snuggled	vbd

I	ppss

Infinite	jj

Idiot's	nn$

I	ppss

I	ppss
felt	vbd
no	at
conflict	nn
between	in
what	wdt
I	ppss
was	bedz
doing	vbg
and	cc
my	pp$
strict	jj

I	ppss
had	hvd
always	rb

and	cc
many	ap

I	ppss

who	wps
,	,
being	beg
thirty	cd

brought	vbd
a	at

to	in

that	cs
the	at

around	in

could	md
know	vb
nothing	pn

I	ppss
had	hvd
also	rb
thought	vbn
a	at

about	in
how	wrb
God	np
must	md
look	vb
on	in

,	,
and	cc
so	rb
in	in
a	at

I	ppss
was	bedz
keeping	vbg
my	pp$

God	np

my	pp$

to	to

pure	jj
until	cs
I	ppss
was	bedz

I	ppss
was	bedz
practically	rb
a	at

after	in
all	abn

There	ex
would	md
have	hv
been	ben
a	at

if	cs

possible	jj

Of	in
this	dt

I	ppss
had	hvd
no	at

Wouldn't	md
Johnnie	np
do	do
practically	rb
anything	pn

my	pp$

?	.
?	.

Of	in

he	pps
would	md

He'd	pps
not	*
only	rb
told	vbn
me	ppo
so	cs
,	,
he'd	pps
proved	vbn
it	ppo

It	pps
wasn't	bedz
Johnnie's	np$
fault	nn
that	cs
he	pps
was	bedz
hopelessly	rb
tied	vbn
down	rp
to	in
that	dt
frightful	jj
woman	nn
who	wps
did	dod
her	pp$
best	jjt
to	to
make	vb
his	pp$
life	nn
unbearable	jj

Just	rb
because	cs
he	pps
was	bedz
honorable	jj
enough	qlp
to	to
want	vb
to	to
continue	vb
supporting	vbg
his	pp$
two	cd
children	nns
,	,
as	cs
any	dti

that	dt

he	pps

And	cc
if	cs
I	ppss

I'd	ppss

The	at

No	at

too	ql

And	cc
I	ppss
had	hvd
no	at

I'd	ppss
never	rb

and	cc
after	cs

he	pps
never	rb

not	*
until	cs
I	ppss
all	abn

He	pps

plenty	rb
attentive	jj

all	ql
right	rb

but	cc
he	pps
behaved	vbd
like	cs
a	at

and	cc
I	ppss
figured	vbd
that	cs
,	,
emotionally	rb
,	,
I	ppss
was	bedz
closer	rbr
to	in
his	pp$

to	in
my	pp$

a	at

What	wdt
could	md
a	at

?	.

It	pps
wasn't	bedz

I	ppss
was	bedz

a	at

a	at

And	cc
hadn't	hvd

She'd	pps

After	in
all	abn

Lucille	np
Warren	np

But	cc

Convention	nn

A	at

in	in

the	at

From	in

I'd	ppss

I	ppss

I'd	ppss

I	ppss
still	rb

But	cc
I	ppss
had	hvd

much	rb
to	in

I	ppss

I	ppss
felt	vbd

about	in

wanted	vbd

I	ppss
wanted	vbd

throw	vb
myself	ppl

this	dt
fine	jj

So	cs
I	ppss
went	vbd
to	in
Boston	np

The	at

My	pp$

at	in

home	nr
I	ppss
was	bedz
staying	vbg
during	in
the	at

introduced	vbd

a	at

of	in
young	jj
people	nns
from	in
Rhode	np
Island	nn
.	.

One	cd

was	bedz
a	at

a	at

blond	jj

He	pps
looked	vbd
very	ql

Johnnie	np
--	--
in	in

he	pps
looked	vbd
sort	nn
of	in

I	ppss
thought	vbd
so	rb
,	,
and	cc
he	pps
mentioned	vbd
it	ppo
,	,
and	cc
Alma	np
said	vbd
so	rb
too	rb
.	.

After	in
the	at
meeting	nn
,	,
there	ex
was	bedz
going	vbg
to	to
be	be
a	at

at	in
someone's	pn$

I	ppss
assumed	vbd
Alma	np

but	cc
in	in
the	at
confusion	nn
of	in
the	at

breaking	vbg

we	ppss
were	bed

Outside	in

I	ppss
anxiously	rb

for	in

then	rb
all	abn
at	in
once	rb
there	ex

``	``

Ronald	np

``	``
Need	vb

I	ppss

``	``
Well	uh

--	--
I	ppss

``	``
Alma	np

Come	vb

I	ppss

By	in
the	at

we	ppss
arrived	vbd

the	at

was	bedz
already	rb
going	vbg
strong	jj

A	at

the	at

were	bed
laughing	vbg
rather	ql
shrilly	rb
and	cc
I	ppss
realized	vbd
they	ppss

My	pp$
folks	nns
wouldn't	md
dream	vb
of	in
having	hvg
alcohol	nn
in	in

so	cs
my	pp$

I	ppss

--	--
it	pps

But	cc
when	wrb
Johnnie	np
disguised	vbd
the	at

with	in
ginger	nn

I	ppss
enjoyed	vbd
it	ppo

Of	in

I	ppss
enjoyed	vbd
'most	rb

Johnnie	np
I	ppss
suddenly	rb

But	cc
that	dt

I	ppss

;	.

surely	rb
he	pps

still	rb
resting	vbg

``	``

Today	nr

He	pps

He	pps

But	cc
the	at

The	at

All	abn

I	ppss

The	at

He	pps

I	ppss

The	at

But	cc

to	to

Yet	rb

at	in

A	at

All	abn

Anthea	np

Clearly	rb

For	in

At	in

The	at
Brainards	nps

Martin	np

But	cc

On	in

it	pps

only	rb

while	cs
she	pps

calm	jj
and	cc
adamant	jj

And	cc
if	cs
he	pps

He	pps

Suppose	vb

At	in

He	pps

In	in

There	ex

feminine	jj

which	wdt
always	rb
made	vbd
him	ppo

He	pps
remembered	vbd

lowering	vbg

He	pps

She	pps

Afterwards	rb

It	pps

But	cc

If	cs

About	in

Angrily	rb

Of	in

In	in

In	in

To	to

Whatever	wdt

Freddy	np

Filling	vbg
Station	nn

paused	vbn

his	pp$

had	hvd
asked	vbn
about	in
the	at
route	nn

San	np

They	ppss
headed	vbd
in	in
that	dt
direction	nn
and	cc

at	in

sitting	vbg

the	at
quaint	jj

Spanish	jj

Drive-in	nn

eating	vbg
a	at

At	in
the	at
moment	nn
,	,
Barco's	np$
back	nn
was	bedz
to	in
the	at

so	cs
he	pps
didn't	dod

the	at

which	wdt
,	,
in	in
their	pp$
quest	nn
for	in

they	ppss
proceeded	vbd
to	to

The	at

however	wrb

missing	vbg

for	cs
by	in
that	dt
time	nn
Barco	np
had	hvd
disposed	vbn
of	in
it	ppo
at	in
a	at

in	in

The	at
detectives	nns
placed	vbd
Barco	np
under	in
arrest	nn
and	cc
,	,
without	in
informing	vbg
him	ppo
of	in
the	at
nature	nn
of	in
the	at
charge	nn
,	,
took	vbd
him	ppo
back	rb
to	in
Hollywood	np
for	in
questioning	vbg

Thus	rb
it	pps
was	bedz
that	cs
Barco	np

apprehended	vbn

now	rb
began	vbd

suspect	vb
that	cs
one	pn
or	cc
another	dt
of	in

been	ben
uncovered	vbn

During	in
the	at
return	nn
trip	nn

Barco	np
kept	vbd
muttering	vbg
to	in
himself	ppl
in	in
meaningless	jj
phrases	nns

such	jj
as	cs
:	:
``	``
They're	ppss

The	at
detective	nn
,	,
commenting	vbg
on	in
Barco's	np$
behavior	nn

felt	vbd
that	cs

merely	rb

However	wrb
while	cs

Barco	np
,	,
in	in
a	at

of	in

made	vbd
an	at

to	to
take	vb
his	pp$

The	at

had	hvd
failed	vbn
because	cs
,	,
when	wrb
endeavoring	vbg
to	to
cut	vb
his	pp$

this	dt
murderer	nn
of	in
seven	cd

had	hvd
fainted	vbn

The	at

--	--
attaching	vbg

--	--
offered	vbd
Barco	np

;	.
;	.

but	cc
the	at

a	at

refused	vbd
it	ppo

and	cc
no	at

Then	rb
it	pps
was	bedz
that	cs
District	nn
Attorney	nn

entered	vbd

A	at

with	in

nothing	pn
ever	rb
escaped	vbd

which	wdt
might	md

It	pps
was	bedz
reported	vbn

that	cs
a	at

in	in

Welch	np
wanted	vbd
to	to
know	vb
why	wrb
.	.

No	at
one	pn
knew	vbd

Now	rb
Welch	np
had	hvd
a	at
pet	nn
theory	nn
that	cs
everyone	pn
is	bez
guilty	jj
of	in
breaking	vbg
more	ap
laws	nns
than	cs
he	pps
ever	rb
gets	vbz
caught	vbn
at	in

The	at
suicide	nn
attempt	nn
looked	vbd
to	in
him	ppo
like	cs
an	at
opportunity	nn
to	to
put	vb
his	pp$
theory	nn
to	in
the	at
test	nn
.	.

So	cs
he	pps
paid	vbd
a	at
call	nn
on	in
Barco	np
in	in
his	pp$
cell	nn
and	cc
began	vbd
their	pp$

by	in
stating	vbg

:	:

``	``

It'll	pps
be	be

''	''

At	in
first	rb
Barco	np
was	bedz
evasive	jj
and	cc
shifty	jj

But	cc
with	in
Welch's	np$
relentless	jj
pursuit	nn
of	in
the	at

,	,
Barco	np
finally	rb
``	``
broke	vbd
''	''
and	cc
started	vbd
confessing	vbg
to	in
one	cd

after	in
another	dt

By	in
the	at

Barco	np
reached	vbd
the	at

the	at

seemed	vbd
to	in
Welch	np
almost	ql
too	ql
good	jj
to	to
be	be
true	jj

But	cc
if	cs
true	jj

it	pps
was	bedz
the	at

as	cs
the	at

Welch	np
summoned	vbd
jail	nn

to	in
Barco's	np$
cell	nn
.	.

But	cc
to	in
Welch's	np$
chagrin	nn
,	,
the	at
police	nn

pooh-poohed	vbd
Welch's	np$
credulity	nn

Barco	np
was	bedz
clearly	rb
a	at

It	pps
required	vbd

``	``
That	dt

Then	rb

a	at

It	pps

He	pps

A	at

I	ppss

Well	uh

One	cd

there	ex

a	at

Viola	np

not	*

she	pps

gone	vbn

She	pps
arrived	vbd
late	rb
and	cc
as	cs
she	pps
entered	vbd
the	at

,	,
noted	vbd
that	cs
gentlemen	nns
seemed	vbd
to	to

the	at
air	nn

empty	jj

several	ap

somewhat	rb

Naturally	rb
,	,
Viola	np
had	hvd
no	at

in	in

And	cc
it	pps

while	cs

a	at

as	cs
Fate	nn

have	hv
it	ppo

belonged	vbd

District	nn

As	cs
Viola	np
sat	vbd
there	rb
,	,
a	at

A	at

And	cc
then	rb
again	rb

He	pps

It	pps
